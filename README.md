# FreeRTOS
FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system (RTOS) specifically designed for embedded systems.
2- Support all Node MCU boards contain ADC like (ESP8266). 34 ``` 35 * [ESP32](https://github.com/BasilAvad/MovingAverage/tree/main/Examples/esp32). 36 ```bash 37 1- Support all ESP32 boards contain ADC. 38 ``` 39 ## Installation 40 Use the Arduino IDE [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or PlatformIO IDE in VS Code [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org) to update this code. 41 ```bash 42  43 git clone https://github.com/BasilAvad/MovingAverage 44  45 ``` 46 ## Usage 47 * Include and Call the header file  inside your project. 48 ```cpp 49 #include <movingaverage.h> 50 ``` 51 * Create an object of MovingAverage using the constructor. 52 ```cpp 53 MovingAverage sensor1(20); 54 ``` 55 *  Call a member function of the object in the loop function. 56 ```cpp 57 void loop() 58 { 59 int sensorValue1 = analogRead(MicrocontrollerADCPin); 60 float result = sensor1.mafunc(sensorValue1); 61 delay(2) 62 } 63 ``` 64 ## Moving Average Library Test and Result 65 * ðŸŸ¦ The blue line is sensor raw data. 66 * ðŸŸ¥ The red line is the sensor data with a moving average. 67  68 ![COM4 6_15_2023 2_03_10 PM](https://github.com/BasilAvad/MovingAverage/assets/69681817/bbe3f810-01bb-46a5-8662-a3d24ccba380) 69 * For more watch the video -> 70 [Video](https://github.com/BasilAvad/MovingAverage/assets/69681817/a9d82036-8858-4e28-aa69-52e078575ddf) 71  72  73 ## Contributing 74  75  76  77 Pull requests are welcome.
